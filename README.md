#Predicting Used Vehicle Price

Buying or Selling a used vehicle is one of an important decision. In USA 838 people* out of 1000 have access to a vehicle and in Canada 685* people out of 1000 have access to a vehicle. Determining strike price to sell/buy is a cumbersome process which takes time and energy. Hence, my project is to provide determined price to sell/buy a vehicle with ease and comfort. 
Through building used vehicle price prediction model, I would provide individuals(consumer) as well as dealer the ease to determining strike price. Hence, avoiding losing if vehicle is sold on a lower than market price and, also losing if buying at price higher than market price. 
This project provides a great highlight of data analysis fundamentals as well as an understanding of more advanced concepts such as Machine Learning Pipelines as well as Natural Language Processing, data cleaning, data normalizing, Deep Learning and model evaluation. Packages demonstrated include pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, and nltk.

### Prerequisites

The following packages are required in addition to python. Please install at your own risk.

seaborn for visualizations: conda install seaborn

scikit-learn for machine learning toolbox conda install scikit-learn

```

### Data

Data was found through open-source website Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data)

Data set was scraped every few months from Craigslist since October 2018 and was last updated on 2020-12-03. Also, Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale. This dataset  includes every used vehicle entry within the United States on Craigslist.
Data file is 1.34 GB containing 458,213 observations and 26 dimensions.
