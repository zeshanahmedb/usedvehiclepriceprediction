# Predicting Used Vehicle Price

Buying or Selling a used vehicle is one of an important decision. In USA 838 people* out of 1000 have access to a vehicle and in Canada 685* people out of 1000 have access to a vehicle. Determining strike price to sell/buy is a cumbersome process which takes time and energy. Hence, my project is to provide determined price to sell/buy a vehicle with ease and comfort. 
Through building used vehicle price prediction model, I would provide individuals(consumer) as well as dealer the ease to determining strike price. Hence, avoiding losing if vehicle is sold on a lower than market price and, also losing if buying at price higher than market price. 
This project provides a great highlight of data analysis fundamentals as well as an understanding of more advanced concepts such as Machine Learning Pipelines as well as Natural Language Processing, data cleaning, data normalizing, Deep Learning and model evaluation. Packages demonstrated include pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, and nltk.
