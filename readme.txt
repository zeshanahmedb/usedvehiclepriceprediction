Project Name
This project is a part of the Capstone Project for BrainStation Diploma. Predicting Used vehicle prices


Determining price of a vehicle for sale and purchase is a cumbersome process which involves time and energy. 
My model will provide range of price for a vehicle to be sold or bought.
